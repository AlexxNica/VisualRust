Visual Studio extension for Rust
================================

![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/BKyAnmY.png)

Currently in development, and not feature complete. Available [on the Visual
Studio extension
gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/dcd9075c-46da-4164-be4a-4d09589efcad).

Contributing
============

To build this, you'll need the [Visual Studio
SDK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/vextend.aspx), otherwise you
can't even open the project. Nuget will take care of the rest.

Feel free to work on any issues tagged "ready", or ask around in
`#rust-gamedev` on irc.mozilla.org for how you can help.

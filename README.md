Visual Studio extension for Rust
================================

Currently in development, and not feature complete. Once it's released,
installation and usage instructions will be added here.

Contributing
============

To build this, you'll need the [Visual Studio
SDK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/vextend.aspx), otherwise you
can't even open the project. Nuget will take care of the rest.

There is a [Waffle board](https://waffle.io/cmr/VisualRust). Feel free to take
any of the issues in the "Ready" column (corresponds to the "ready" tag on
issues).

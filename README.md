================================

![Screenshot](http://i.imgur.com/T06C5wH.png)

Currently in development, and not feature complete. Available [on the Visual
Studio extension
gallery](http://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/dcd9075c-46da-4164-be4a-4d09589efcad).

Contributing
============

To build this, you'll need the [Visual Studio
SDK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/vextend.aspx) for the VS plugin and
[WiX Toolset 3.9](http://wixtoolset.org/) for the setup project. Nuget will
take care of the rest.

This project is currently maintained by [vosen](https://github.com/vosen/).

Feel free to work on any issues tagged "ready". Alternatively you can mail
the maintainer or ask in `#rust-gamedev` on irc.mozilla.org for how you can
help.

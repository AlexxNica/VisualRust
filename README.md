================================

Currently in development, and not feature complete. Once it's released, 
installation and usage instructions will be added here.

============

To build this, you'll need the [Visual Studio SDK](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/vstudio/vextend.aspx), 
otherwise you can't even open the project. Nuget will take care of the rest.
